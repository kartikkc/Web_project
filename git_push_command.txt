first of all 
  (this method is the easy one)
  1.)create a repo on github 
  2.)Clone it to create a origin automatically or else it will be complicated
  3.)Now iniate git on it using "git init"
  4.)Now add which files you want to add on it using "git add -A (for all files)"
  5.)Now run "git status" command to check status
  6.)Now commit to the files you added or the changes you have made using "git commit" or "git commit -m"(for large number of files)
  7.)After commiting now you can finally push the changes on github using "git push origin main(to push to main branch) "commmand 
  
  
Now, 
for a seprate folder that is not created on github

initalize git 
add that file to git
commit
MAIN PART STARTS HERE
create an empty github repo
use git remote add origin "link with out double quotes"
use -u to  set upstream and after that i dont have to type origin main agian and again
